# Kotlin Mysteries

## Introduction

A lot of what we know today about the Kotlin programming language is great and we use it today very often in both server-side programming and of course for android. Kotlin has shown to have a lot of benefits when it comes to programming especially when talking about parallelism, concurrent programming, coroutines, null-safety and immutability. When it comes to programming with Kotlin, there are, however some things that escape the ordinary and aren't exactly easy to understand. This repository is here to explain these different concepts in details according to these different topics:

1. [Null Safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html) - [NullSafety](NullSafety.md)
2. [Inline](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-functions.html) - [Inline](Inline.md)
3. [Tail Call Optimization](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#tail-recursive-functions) - [TailCallOptimization](TailCallOptimization.md)
4. [Annotation use-site targets](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/annotations.html#annotation-use-site-targets) - [UseSiteTargets](UseSiteTargets.md)
5. Others - [Others](Others.md)
